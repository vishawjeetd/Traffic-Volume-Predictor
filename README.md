# Traffic Volume Prediction Hackathon


Welcome to the Traffic Volume Prediction Hackathon repository! In this project, we aimed to predict traffic volume on roadways using various machine learning models. We conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for modeling. After extensive testing across multiple models, we selected the best-performing model for traffic volume prediction.
